SERVICES & PRICING (AUD)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TEETH CLEANING AND CHECK-UP
   Price : From $180
   About : Regular routine check-ups are important — not just for the
           teeth but also the gums and the mouth as a whole. If there
           are any changes that need to be treated, such as tooth decay
           or gum disease, these can often be detected in the early
           stages, making treatment more straightforward.

2. DENTAL IMPLANTS
   Price : From $2,500 per implant (single tooth)
   About : Missing or severely damaged teeth can really impact how you
           go about your day-to-day life. If you feel self-conscious,
           experience pain or struggle to eat, dental implant surgery
           will help restore your natural, healthy smile.

3. ALL-ON-4 DENTAL IMPLANTS
   Price : From $18,000 – $25,000 per arch
   About : A permanent and stable solution for patients looking for
           immediate replacement of all teeth on 4 dental implants.
           Four implants are inserted into the jaw and teeth are
           affixed, giving a natural-looking and feeling smile.

4. DENTAL FILLINGS
   Price : From $150 – $300 per tooth (composite/tooth-coloured)
   About : Damaged or decaying teeth can be restored to their usual
           function, appearance and feel through dental fillings.
           Commonly used as treatment for cavities. Usually
           non-invasive and completed in just one visit.

5. WISDOM TEETH REMOVAL
   Price : From $300 – $500 per tooth (simple)
           From $500 – $900 per tooth (surgical)
   About : Wisdom teeth can cause pain, discomfort and long-term
           impact if not removed professionally. Oral surgery is
           often needed to extract wisdom teeth safely and effectively.

6. EMERGENCY DENTAL SERVICES
   Price : From $150 – $250 (emergency consultation & assessment)
   About : We understand that conditions like toothache, broken tooth,
           sudden injury or denture breakages require urgent attention.
           We will always do our best to accommodate emergency cases
           on the same day, regardless of whether you've seen us before.

7. CLEAR ALIGNERS
   Price : From $2,500 – $9,000 (full treatment, complexity dependent)
   About : An alternative to traditional braces. Experience the
           transformative power of a straight, radiant smile that goes
           beyond aesthetics — it also means a healthier, better-
           functioning mouth. Expert independent dentists offer a range
           of clear aligner options.

8. DENTAL CROWNS AND BRIDGES
   Price : From $1,500 – $2,200 per crown (ceramic/porcelain)
           From $1,800 – $3,000 per bridge (3-unit)
   About : Your teeth can get damaged, worn down or suffer decay after
           years of use, cracks or trauma. Crowns and bridges help
           keep your smile protected and restore normal function.

9. ROOT CANAL TREATMENT
   Price : From $900 – $1,800 per tooth (complexity dependent)
   About : Root canal treatment (endodontic treatment) is needed when
           a tooth's nerve is infected, inflamed or beginning to die.
           It saves the tooth and eliminates pain caused by infection.

10. CUSTOM MOUTHGUARDS
    Price : From $220 – $400
    About : A mouthguard protects your teeth and mouth from injury.
            Commonly needed for those who play contact sports.
            Custom-fit professional mouthguards are the only way to
            properly protect your smile.

11. DENTAL VENEERS
    Price : From $1,200 – $2,000 per tooth (porcelain)
            From $600 – $900 per tooth (composite)
    About : Dental veneers are ideal if you are experiencing chipped,
            stained, discoloured or crooked teeth. They improve the
            overall appearance and feel of your smile. Available in
            porcelain/ceramic or direct composite.

12. TOOTH EXTRACTION
    Price : From $180 – $350 (simple extraction)
    About : Sometimes teeth are so severely damaged, broken or worn
            down that tooth extraction is the right choice. We always
            explore every option before recommending extraction.

13. GUM DISEASE TREATMENT (PERIODONTITIS)
    Price : From $200 – $600 per session
    About : An infection or inflammation of the gums is a sign of
            gum disease (Periodontitis). If you feel tender,
            experience bleeding or see inflamed gums, see your
            dentist as soon as possible to minimise pain and damage.

14. DENTURES
    Price : From $1,200 – $1,800 (partial dentures)
            From $1,800 – $3,000 (full arch dentures)
    About : Dentures are artificial teeth that look just like the
            real thing, made from durable acrylic or metal. They are
            removable, great for replacing missing teeth and help
            retain normal speech and chewing capacity.

15. BRACES
    Price : From $4,500 – $8,000 (full treatment)
    About : Braces (banding) are the best choice when you want to
            alter your bite and overall alignment. Cost-effective and
            able to address a wide range of dental issues.

            the colour of your teeth without permanent treatments.

            way to look and feel fresh and healthy.
