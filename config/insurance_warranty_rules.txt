   b. The patient has followed all post-treatment care instructions provided by the dentist.
   c. The patient has attended all recommended follow-up appointments.
   d. Damage caused by teeth grinding (bruxism) is NOT covered unless a prescribed mouthguard was used consistently.
   e. The warranty period varies by treatment — please confirm the exact period with your dentist at time of treatment.
3. To make a warranty claim, call us to book a review appointment.
4. Warranty is non-transferable and applies only to the original patient.
