[TREATMENTS]

Teeth Cleaning and Check-Up:
  What to expect: The dentist will examine your teeth, gums and mouth
    for signs of decay, gum disease or other issues. A professional
    clean removes plaque and tartar build-up from all surfaces.
  Duration: Approximately 45–60 minutes.
  Preparation: Brush and floss before your appointment. Let the dentist
    know about any pain, sensitivity or changes you've noticed.
  Aftercare: Maintain regular brushing and flossing. Book your next
    check-up in 6 months.

Dental Fillings:
  What to expect: The decayed portion of the tooth is removed and
    filled with composite resin (tooth-coloured material). Local
    anaesthetic is used so you won't feel pain during the procedure.
  Duration: 30–60 minutes per tooth.
  Preparation: Eat before your appointment as you may be numb
    for a few hours after.
  Aftercare: Avoid eating for 1–2 hours after. Avoid very hot or cold
    foods for 24 hours. Mild sensitivity is normal for a few days.

Root Canal Treatment:
  What to expect: The infected pulp inside the tooth is removed, the
    root canal is cleaned, shaped and sealed. Local anaesthetic is used
    throughout. May require 2–3 visits depending on complexity.
  Duration: 60–90 minutes per session.
  Preparation: Eat a light meal beforehand. Inform dentist of any
    current medications.
  Aftercare: Mild soreness for a few days — completely normal. Avoid
    chewing on that side until fully restored with a crown. Over-the-
    counter pain relief may be used as directed by your dentist.

Dental Crowns and Bridges:
  What to expect: A crown is a custom-made cap placed over a damaged
    tooth to restore its shape, size and strength. A bridge replaces
    one or more missing teeth by anchoring to adjacent teeth.
    First visit: tooth preparation and impressions taken.
    Second visit: permanent crown/bridge fitted.
  Duration: Two appointments of approximately 60 minutes each.
  Preparation: A temporary crown will be placed between visits —
    treat it gently.
  Aftercare: Temporary crown sensitivity is normal. Avoid sticky or
    hard foods until the permanent crown is fitted. Once permanent,
    care for it like a natural tooth.

Dental Implants:
  What to expect: A titanium post is surgically placed into the jawbone
    to act as an artificial tooth root. After a healing period of
    3–6 months (osseointegration), a custom crown is attached on top.
    This is the most natural-looking and permanent tooth replacement.
  Duration: Multiple appointments over 3–9 months total.
  Preparation: A thorough dental examination and X-rays are taken
    first to assess bone density.
  Aftercare: Follow post-surgical care instructions carefully. Avoid
    smoking as it significantly affects healing. Maintain excellent
    oral hygiene. Attend all follow-up appointments.

All-on-4 Dental Implants:
  What to expect: Four dental implants are strategically inserted into
    the jaw and a full arch of fixed teeth is attached on the same day.
    This is a permanent, stable solution for patients who have lost
    most or all of their teeth. Results are immediate — you leave with
    a new set of fixed teeth.
  Duration: The surgical procedure is typically completed in one day,
    with follow-up appointments for the final prosthesis.
  Preparation: Comprehensive assessment, X-rays and 3D scans are
    required before surgery.
  Aftercare: Soft food diet for several weeks. Strict oral hygiene
    routine. Regular check-ups every 6 months essential.

Wisdom Teeth Removal:
  What to expect: The tooth is removed under local anaesthetic.
    Surgical cases (impacted teeth) may require sedation, incisions
    and stitches. Simple cases are straightforward extractions.
  Duration: 30–60 minutes per tooth.
  Preparation: Fast for 6 hours before if sedation is used. Arrange
    transport home as you won't be able to drive after sedation.
  Aftercare: Swelling and mild discomfort for 3–5 days is normal.
    Apply ice pack to cheek. Eat soft foods only. Avoid smoking.
    Keep the area clean — rinse gently with warm salt water after
    24 hours. Stitches dissolve on their own in 7–10 days.

Emergency Dental Services:
  What to expect: We accommodate emergency patients on the same day.
    The dentist will assess and manage pain, broken teeth, sudden
    injuries or denture breakages as a priority. Treatment plan is
    provided after the initial assessment.
  What qualifies: Severe toothache, broken or chipped tooth, dental
    injury, lost filling or crown, swollen face or gum, loose tooth
    in adults, denture breakage.
  What to do before arrival: Rinse with warm water. If a tooth is
    knocked out, keep it moist (in milk or saliva) and come in
    immediately — time is critical.

Clear Aligners:
  What to expect: A series of clear, removable, custom-made plastic
    trays gradually shift teeth into the correct position. Each tray
    is worn for 1–2 weeks before moving to the next set. Virtually
    invisible when worn.
  Duration: Typically 6–18 months depending on complexity.
  Preparation: Initial consultation to assess suitability. Digital
    scans or impressions taken to plan treatment.
  Aftercare: Wear aligners 20–22 hours per day without fail. Remove
    only to eat, drink (except water) and clean teeth. Clean aligners
    daily with a soft toothbrush. Attend regular check-up appointments
    every 6–8 weeks.

Custom Mouthguards:
  What to expect: Impressions of your teeth are taken and sent to a
    dental lab where a custom-fit mouthguard is made specifically for
    your mouth. Far superior protection compared to over-the-counter
    mouthguards which can shift and provide poor protection.
  Duration: Two short appointments — impressions taken, then fitting.
  Who needs one: Anyone playing contact sports (football, rugby,
    boxing, basketball, hockey, martial arts). Also used for teeth
    grinding (bruxism) at night.
  Aftercare: Rinse after use, store in provided case. Bring to dental
    appointments to check fit as teeth shift over time.

Dental Veneers:
  What to expect: Thin porcelain or composite shells are bonded to
    the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance.
    A small amount of enamel is permanently removed from the tooth
    surface first. Porcelain veneers require two visits;
    composite can be done in one.
  Duration: Two appointments for porcelain (lab-made).
    One appointment for composite (done chairside).
  Preparation: Discuss goals and desired shade with your dentist.
    The process is irreversible — take your time deciding.
  Aftercare: Avoid biting hard objects (ice, pens, nails). Brush and
    floss normally. Veneers are permanent. Porcelain lasts
    10–15 years; composite 5–7 years.

Tooth Extraction:
  What to expect: The tooth and surrounding area is numbed with local
    anaesthetic. The tooth is loosened using dental instruments and
    removed. Simple extractions are quick and straightforward.
  Duration: 20–40 minutes.
  Preparation: Inform your dentist of all current medications and
    medical conditions before the procedure.
  Aftercare: Bite on gauze for 30–45 minutes to stop bleeding.
    Do NOT rinse for 24 hours — it dislodges the clot. Eat soft
    foods only. No smoking for at least 48 hours. Mild pain and
    swelling for 2–3 days is normal.

Gum Disease Treatment (Periodontitis):
  What to expect: Deep cleaning (scale and root planing) removes
    plaque and tartar from below the gumline where regular brushing
    cannot reach. Local anaesthetic may be used. Severe cases may
    require additional treatment or referral.
  Duration: 60–90 minutes per session. May require 2–4 visits.
  Preparation: Brush and floss before your appointment. Be honest
    about your oral hygiene routine — the dentist is here to help.
  Aftercare: Gums may be tender and slightly swollen for a few days —
    completely normal. Maintain daily brushing and flossing. Follow-
    up appointments are critical to monitor recovery. Improvement
    should be visible within a few weeks.

Dentures:
  What to expect: Custom-made removable replacements for missing teeth.
    Measurements, impressions and shade selection are taken at the first
    visit and sent to a dental lab. The dentures are fitted and adjusted
    at a follow-up visit. May require a few adjustments for comfort.
  Duration: Multiple appointments. Lab turnaround typically 1–3 weeks.
  Types:
    Full dentures — replace all teeth in an arch.
    Partial dentures — replace several missing teeth.
  Aftercare: Initial soreness and increased saliva are normal and
    temporary. Remove and clean dentures every day. Soak overnight
    in a denture-cleaning solution. Never sleep with dentures in
    during the first few weeks. Attend regular check-ups.

Braces:
  What to expect: Metal or ceramic brackets are bonded to the teeth
    and connected by wires that apply gentle pressure to gradually
    move teeth and correct bite alignment. Adjustments are made at
    regular visits every 4–6 weeks.
  Duration: Typically 12–24 months depending on complexity.
  Preparation: A thorough orthodontic assessment and X-rays are taken
    to plan treatment. Some teeth may need to be extracted first.
  Aftercare: Avoid hard, sticky or chewy foods (popcorn, caramel,
    hard lollies, raw carrots). Brush carefully around brackets after
    every meal. Use a floss threader or interdental brush to clean
    between teeth. Wear retainer after braces are removed — this is
    essential to keep teeth in position.

Teeth Whitening:
  What to expect: A professional-strength bleaching gel is applied to
    the teeth and activated by a special light (in-chair). Results are
    immediate and dramatic. Take-home kits use a lower concentration
    gel worn in custom trays for 1–2 weeks.
  Duration: In-chair: approximately 60–90 minutes.
    Take-home: 30–60 minutes per day for 1–2 weeks.
  Preparation: A check-up is recommended before whitening to ensure
    teeth and gums are healthy. Whitening does not work on crowns,
    veneers or fillings.
  Aftercare: Teeth may be sensitive for 24–48 hours — completely
    normal. Avoid staining foods and drinks (coffee, tea, red wine,
    curry) for at least 48 hours after. Results last 6–12 months
    depending on diet and oral hygiene.

Zoom Whitening (In-Chair):
  What to expect: Zoom is a professional in-chair whitening system
    that can lighten teeth by up to 8 shades in just one hour.
    A hydrogen peroxide gel is applied and activated using the Zoom
    light. Three 15-minute sessions are completed in one appointment.
  Duration: Approximately 60–75 minutes total.
  Preparation: A dental check-up is recommended first. Teeth cleaning
    before the session gives the best results.
  Aftercare: Sensitivity for 24–48 hours is normal. Avoid staining
    foods/drinks for 48 hours. Use sensitivity toothpaste if needed.
    Results can last 1–2 years with good oral hygiene.

Children's Dentistry:
  What to expect: Gentle check-ups, professional cleans, fluoride
    treatments, fissure sealants and preventive care tailored
    specifically for children. We create a calm, friendly and
    fun environment to help children feel comfortable and reduce
    dental anxiety from a young age.
  Duration: 30–45 minutes.
  At what age to start: First dental visit recommended by age 1 or
    when the first tooth appears.
  Preparation: Bring your child's dental history if available.
    Bring a favourite toy or comfort item. Talk positively about the
    visit beforehand to reduce anxiety.
  Aftercare: Supervise brushing until age 7–8. Use child-strength
    fluoride toothpaste. Limit sugary snacks and drinks.
    Check eligibility for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS)
    — your child may qualify for free dental care.

[GENERAL DENTAL HEALTH TIPS]
- Brush teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste.
